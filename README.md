# cpnt260-a3

this is for assignment 3 of cpnt 260!

in it i am creating a page for a website that's for a store that's opening soon and they really really want people to join their mailing list!

it shares a lot of things from my previous splash page assignment because that's the fake website i based it off of!
I felt super cool getting rid of the borders and stuff on the input part because it seems like most actual websites have it like that now!

also the author's name is me, Lauren Kruger!
